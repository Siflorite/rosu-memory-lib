# rosu-memory-lib

A modular Rust library for reading osu! memory, forked from [rosu-memory](https://github.com/486c/rosu-memory).

Forked from original [rosu-memory-lib v1.2.0](https://github.com/Glubus/rosu-memory-lib), to fix the breaking signature change ([the same with gosumemory](https://github.com/Glubus/rosu-memory-lib), [fixed in tosu](https://github.com/tosuapp/tosu/blob/33af090bba8ea0c51c267ecf2cba34e0f80775d7/packages/tosu/src/memory/stable.ts)) for personal use.

## Overview

While rosu_memory was originally designed as a binary application, this fork transforms it into a flexible library that can be integrated into any Rust project. This architectural change allows developers to build their own tools and applications around osu! memory reading capabilities.

## Features

- Memory reading for stable (lazer support may come soon)
- Modular design allowing custom implementations
- Callback system for real-time data processing
- Type-safe memory access
- Cross-platform support (Windows primary focus)


Basic example:
```rust
use rosu_memory_lib::reader::{init_loop, waiting_for_play};

fn main() -> eyre::Result<()> {
    // Initialize the memory reader
    let (mut state, process) = init_loop(500)?;

    // Wait for gameplay with optional callback
    waiting_for_play(&process, &mut state, Some(|p, state| {
        println!("beatmap title: {}", rosu_memory_lib::reader::beatmap::stable::get_title(p,state))
        Ok(())
    }))?;

    Ok(())
}
```

## Examples

Check out the `examples/` directory for various implementations and use cases.

## Language Bindings

The library provides bindings for multiple programming languages (not finished):

### Python
Python bindings are available in the `bindings/python` directory. They provide a Pythonic interface to the library's functionality using PyO3.

Example:
```python
from rosu_memory import init_loop, get_beatmap_info

# Initialize the memory reader
state, process = init_loop(500)

# Get current beatmap info
beatmap = get_beatmap_info(process, state)
print(f"Playing: {beatmap.metadata.title_romanized}")
```
